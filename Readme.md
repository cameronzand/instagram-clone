InSuhGram  is a fun photo-sharing application that allows users to upload, comment on, and vote for images shared across the app.
Working on this project was an important learning experience with regard to back end frameworks and practicing with SQL, and provided useful practice in working on larger projects in a team-setting with a shared repository. This project is also one of our first successful large-scale implementations of an Angular app that relies on the angular-ui-router. The back-end was constructed using AdonisJS.
